Description: Bloat-free Immediate Mode Graphical User interface for C++
 Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs
 optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline
 enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained
 (no external dependencies).
 .
 This package contains the development files.
